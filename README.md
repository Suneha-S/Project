HR Analytics – Employee Attrition Prediction

Project Objective
This project aims to:
- Predict employee attrition using historical HR data.
- Identify key factors contributing to employee resignations.
- Provide actionable insights and strategies to reduce attrition.

Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)
- Power BI
- Jupyter Notebook
- Excel (.xls data source)

Key Insights
- Top Predictors of attrition include: Overtime, Monthly Income, Years at Company, Job Role, Distance from Home.
- High-Risk Groups: Employees with <2 years of service, overtime workers, low-income staff, especially in Sales and Support departments.

Model Summary
- Model Used: Random Forest Classifier
- Accuracy: ~84%
- Evaluation Metrics: Confusion Matrix, F1-score, Precision, Recall

Dashboards
- A dynamic Power BI Dashboard highlights real-time attrition metrics, department/job-wise breakdown, and high-risk employees.
- Visuals include KPIs, bar charts, pie charts, box plots, and an interactive table.
